## 🧭 1. Dashboard Blueprint (Strategic / Operational Use)

Use dashboards to monitor progress and trigger decisions in near-real-time.

### 🎯 Purpose  
Track performance KPIs and operational metrics to inform quick decision-making or monitor strategic progress.

### 🧱 Template Structure

| Section              | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Title / Scope        | Dashboard name (e.g. Sales Performance – Q2 2025)                           |
| Metric Overview      | Top KPIs with trend indicators (e.g. YoY Growth, CAC, Churn)                |
| Filters              | Time range, segment, geography, etc.                                        |
| Data Blocks          | Visuals per objective: time-series charts, bar plots, funnel breakdowns     |
| Callouts / Alerts    | Threshold warnings, notes, or actions                                        |

## 🎯 2. OKR Reporting Template (Team or Department)

OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) help align team-level efforts with company goals.

### 🧱 Template Structure

```text
Objective: Increase Customer Retention in Q3

Key Result 1: Reduce monthly churn rate from 7% to 4%
  - 📊 Metric: Churn Rate
  - ✅ Status: On Track
  - 🔍 Insight: Drop in churn linked to improved onboarding NPS

Key Result 2: Increase active users logging in weekly from 25k to 40k
  - 📊 Metric: WAU (Weekly Active Users)
  - ⚠️ Status: At Risk
  - 🔍 Insight: Drop-off among mobile users in Germany
```

Add visual KPIs to support each key result in performance reporting tools or decks.

## 📝 3. Briefing Format for Executives

🧱 Template Structure
| Section        | Description                                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Context        | Define the business problem / question being addressed                   |
| Key Insight    | 1–3 short bullets with supporting evidence (charts, KPIs, survey quotes) |
| Recommendation | Clear next step based on the insight (what, who, when)                   |
| Impact         | Quantified or strategic value if acted upon                              |

*Use this format for succinct reporting of findings to leadership or stakeholders.*

## 📁 Examples in Practice
* All project dashboards in this repository follow the structure above.
* Business briefs can be found in the /data-projects/ folder.
* Each README.md uses modified OKR-style goal tracking where applicable.

## 🧠 Why Structure Matters
Clear reporting frameworks help reduce ambiguity, support faster decision-making, and ensure everyone is acting on the same signal – not noise.
