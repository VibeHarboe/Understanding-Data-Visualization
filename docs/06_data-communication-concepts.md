- **Applications:** Dashboard walkthroughs, executive summaries, and pitch decks.

### 2. Audience-Centric Communication
- **Real-World Context:** Knowing when to show SQL output versus business impact KPIs.
- **Key Questions:**  
  - What does the audience already know?

  - What level of technical detail is appropriate?

### 3. Structuring Reports for Action
- **Real-World Context:** Ensuring reports are skim-friendly, strategically ordered, and focused on decision-making.
- **Frameworks Used:**  
  - **Pyramid Principle:** Start with the recommendation, then support it with logic and evidence.

- **Applications:**  
  - Monthly sales performance recaps  
  - Investor updates  
  - Product analytics briefs

## 🧠 Example Use Case

> As a Data Analyst, I used the SCQA structure to present sales decline across EU markets. By opening with the situation (YoY trends), highlighting the complication (Q2 churn increase), and ending with action (recommendations to optimize acquisition funnels), I secured stakeholder buy-in for a pilot strategy that cut churn by 12%.
