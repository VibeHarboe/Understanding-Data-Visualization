# Visualizing Two Variables

This chapter explores how to visualize relationships between two variables. The aim is to help identify trends, correlations, and patterns that would be difficult to discern from raw numbers alone. Each visualization method is selected based on whether the variables involved are continuous or categorical.

## Key Concepts

* **Continuous vs. Categorical Variables**: Understanding variable types is crucial for choosing the appropriate plot.
* **Scatter plots**: Show relationships between two continuous variables.
* **Line plots**: Best suited for showing trends over time.
* **Bar plots**: Useful for comparisons between categories.
* **Box plots**: Allow comparisons across categories, especially useful when one variable is continuous and the other categorical.
* **Dot plots**: Help visualize small differences across categories.

### 4. Comparing Groups with Box Plots

**Prompt**: Use box plots to compare test scores across different schools. Which school has the highest median? Which has more variability?

## Summary

Understanding how to select and interpret two-variable visualizations is key to effective data storytelling. Use scatter plots for relationships, line plots for trends, and categorical plots like bar and box plots for comparisons.
