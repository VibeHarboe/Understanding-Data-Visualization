# 📊 Visualizing Distributions

**Course:** Understanding Data Visualization (DataCamp)
**Chapter:** 1 – Visualizing Distributions

---

## 🎯 Goal

Visually identify which year between 2016 and 2020 started with the highest Bitcoin price. This introductory exercise highlights the power of exploratory data visualization as a faster and more intuitive way to extract insights than summary statistics alone.

---

## 📈 Visualization Insight

The chart shows the Bitcoin price trend from 2016 to 2020. Red dots mark the price on January 1st of each year.

**Observation:**
▶️ 2018 began with the highest Bitcoin price (\~\$14,000–\$15,000).
This demonstrates how well-designed plots can quickly reveal trends and anomalies in data that might not be obvious in raw tables or numeric summaries.

## 🛠️ SQL Use

No SQL code is used in this specific exercise. It is purely interpretative and designed to build visual intuition for data distributions.

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

* Understand how visual encoding (position, color, scale) drives insight
* Recognize distribution patterns without relying on statistical metrics
* Use visuals to identify meaningful breakpoints, trends, and anomalies in time series data
