# 📊 99 Problems But a Plot Ain't One

**Course:** Understanding Data Visualization (DataCamp)
**Chapter:** 4 – 99 Problems But a Plot Ain't One

---

This chapter focuses on recognizing and avoiding **common mistakes in data visualization**. You’ll learn how to improve the readability, accuracy, and effectiveness of your plots by avoiding misleading design choices and choosing appropriate visual forms for your data.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

* **Chartjunk**
  Avoid unnecessary decorations, 3D effects, and clutter that distract from the message.

* **Mismatched Axes & Scales**
  Ensure axes reflect appropriate starting points and scale units.

* **Choosing the Right Plot Type**
  Match the chart to your variable types and analysis goals.

* **Color Misuse**
  Use perceptually accurate palettes that do not mislead or obscure information.

* **Overplotting & Misleading Aggregation**
  Be cautious of binning, stacking, or summarizing that can distort the interpretation.

## 📋 Exercise: Pie Plots

Pie plots convert bar data into circular segments but are harder for humans to interpret due to the difficulty in perceiving angles compared to lengths. This exercise uses alcohol consumption data from the Health Survey for England. Each age group is shown as a pie chart and a bar chart for better comparison.

### ✅ Correct Interpretation

> All age groups had at least 50% of people drinking up to 14 units per week.

## 🌬️ Exercise: Rose Plots

**Rose plots** (polar histograms) are useful when visualizing circular data such as compass directions. The exercise presents wind direction data recorded every 10 minutes over an eight-month period using a meteorological mast. Knowing predominant wind directions is crucial for both weather modeling and optimizing wind turbine placement.

### ✅ Correct Interpretation
> **The predominant wind directions were N and SW.**
