Delivering data insights is not just about the numbers — it’s about **connecting insight to impact**. This guide outlines how to effectively present your analysis in high-stakes settings such as stakeholder meetings, leadership briefings, or client pitches.

## 🎯 1. Know Your Audience

| Stakeholder Level      | Preferred Format                    |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Executives             | Summary-first, business context     |
| Mid-level Managers     | Actionable insights, KPIs, impact   |
| Technical Teams        | Methods, logic, data provenance     |

👂 _Tip_: Preempt key questions they might ask (e.g. *“How was this calculated?”* or *“Why should I care?”*).

---

## 🎬 2. Structure Like a Narrative

Use the classic structure:
- **Problem**: What's the business challenge?
- **Insight**: What does the data show?
- **Impact**: What action should be taken?

🎓 _Example_:  
“Customer churn increased by 7% in Q2. The drop is correlated with onboarding duration delays. Streamlining onboarding could reduce churn and increase net revenue retention.”

## 📊 3. Visuals Over Tables

| Use This...                | Instead of...               |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| KPI dashboard slide        | Spreadsheet screenshot      |
| Trend line with annotations| Dense time series table     |
| Bar chart by segment       | Paragraph explanation       |

💡 _Rule of thumb_: If it takes >5 seconds to interpret, simplify.

---

## 🧠 4. Anchor Every Insight to a Business Metric

Always link findings to KPIs:
- Revenue, churn, conversion, CAC, LTV, NPS, etc.
- Use familiar terminology from stakeholder OKRs or dashboards

🗣️ _Tip_: Say “This metric affects your Q3 goal of increasing onboarding completion by 20%.”

## 🪄 5. Delivery Tactics

| Tip                         | Why it matters                     |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Speak slower than normal    | Audiences need time to absorb      |
| Use pauses strategically    | Helps emphasize key takeaways      |
| Frame transitions clearly   | Keeps the story flow coherent      |
| Don’t overfill slides       | Visual clarity = cognitive clarity |
| End with a single ask       | Be clear on next step or decision  |

---

## 🧰 Slide Composition Tips

- 1 insight per slide  
- Add subtitles as conclusions (e.g. *“Churn tied to onboarding delay”*)  
- Place charts top-left where eyes land first  
- Use consistent formatting across the deck

## ✅ Summary: Present Like a Pro

| Do this...                                   | Avoid this...                             |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Lead with the key message                    | Burying insights in technical jargon       |
| Design slides for non-verbal delivery        | Reading entire paragraphs aloud            |
| Tie data directly to business outcomes       | Assuming stakeholders will make the leap   |
