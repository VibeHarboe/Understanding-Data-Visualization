# ðŸ“Š Understanding Data Visualization

This repository is part of my Data Analyst training at DataCamp and focuses on mastering the foundational concepts of **data visualization**. Through SQL and visual storytelling principles, this project illustrates how visual choices impact interpretation and decision-making.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To demonstrate real-world best practices in designing clear, honest, and insightful data visualizations â€” while avoiding misleading or confusing graphs. All exercises are inspired by actual use cases and translated into analytical workflows.

## âœ… What I Learned

* Choosing the right **chart types** for different data distributions
* Spotting and correcting **misleading graphs** (axis abuse, area bias, etc.)
* Using **color, size, and shape** intentionally to reduce noise and increase insight
* Applying the **Grammar of Graphics** principles
* Building credible visuals to **influence stakeholders** and support decision-making

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

* PostgreSQL (via DataCamp SQL workspace)
* DataCamp learning platform
* Markdown & Git for version control

---

## ðŸ’¼ Real-World Scenarios Covered

* Marketing KPIs visualized by segment and region
* Campaign A/B testing through bar and line charts
* Common visual fallacies in business dashboards
