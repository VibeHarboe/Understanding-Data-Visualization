# 📁 data-projects/

This folder contains custom-built, real-world inspired data projects created as part of the *Understanding Data Visualization* course. Unlike synthetic or tutorial examples, these datasets, questions, and analyses mimic real stakeholder needs and simulate business-relevant decision-making processes.

## 📌 Folder Purpose
The `data-projects/` directory is meant to:
- Showcase **standalone analytical projects** using skills learned across chapters.
- Demonstrate **data storytelling** and visualization-driven decision making.
- Bridge the gap between **educational exercises** and **practical portfolio material**.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
These projects help reinforce:
- Designing charts to communicate real metrics.
- Recognizing misleading visuals and correcting them.
- Building clean, interpretable, and insightful data stories.
